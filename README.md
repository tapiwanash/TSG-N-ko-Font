<h2>TSG N'ko is a typeface supporting the N'ko Alphabet of Guinea.</h2>
<p1>N'Ko (N'Ko: ߒߞߏ) was created by Solomana Kante in 1949, as a writing system for the Manding languages of West Africa. The term N'Ko, which means I say in all Manding languages, is also used for the Manding literary standard written in N'Ko script.The introduction of the script led to a movement promoting literacy in the N'Ko script among Manding speakers in both Anglophone and Francophone West Africa. N'Ko literacy was instrumental in shaping the Maninka cultural identity in Guinea, and it has also strengthened the Manding identity in other parts of West Africa.<br>
<br>
The N'Ko script is written from right to left, with letters being connected to one another. N'Ko uses 7 diacritical marks to denote tonality and vowel length. Together with plain vowels, N'Ko distinguishes four tones: high, low, ascending, and descending; and two vowel lengths: long and short. Unmarked signs designate short, descending vowels.<br>
